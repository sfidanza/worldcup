<p>Besides giving information on the competition (which you can find easily anywhere on the web),
this site is mainly a technological prototype. It demonstrates what can be done using client-side templates,
with JSON client-server communication.</p>
<p>The project is hosted on github, and you will find details about the technical features there,
as well as analysis and pointers on the toolchain and development setup (see README and wiki entries):</p>
