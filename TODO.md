# To do

- fix: Support error cases on response.json() parsing (rate limiter can return 429 http codes)
- feat: Internationalize date/time for match schedule
  - Store date in ISO format, or host local format with city timezone
  - Display date in client timezone
- Add hashes to templates to bust cache on new releases
- Extract framework as a dependency to share between apps (needs build rework)
  - "Tahr: A lightweight framework with templating support, data manipulation and basic UI components"
- Deploy on kubernetes
  - Add compress middleware on Traefik (as today on docker)
  - Add REST API security middleware on Traefik (<https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers>)
  - Add basic security middleware on Traefik for frontend resources (as today on docker)
- Add versioning on build
  - Compute next version at start of build, use it to tag published docker images
  - Use version to tag the git repo
  - Publish the Helm chart with the version tag, with pinned container references
- Improve security for frontend resources
  - nginx CSP vs Traefik other headers? Could everything be handled by Traefik?
  - remove `unsafe-inline` for `style-src`
  - remove `unsafe-inline` for `script-src`
- Database
  - MongoDB version support: <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles>
    - Plan migration to another system, as MongoDB 5+ requires more recent/powerful processors than targeted here
  - nodeSelector needed because of hostpath for DB volume
