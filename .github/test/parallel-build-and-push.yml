# Test: run backend and frontend builds in parallel
# Outcome: Conceptually better as each is taking 30s in sequential, a bit more in parallel but time is still gained (total ~45s instead of ~60s)
#     However, jobs are queued until a runner is available. In sequential run, once a runner is found, evertyhing is built. In parallel, we wait 3 times.
#     So if runners are lacking, the parallel workflow actually takes much longer.
